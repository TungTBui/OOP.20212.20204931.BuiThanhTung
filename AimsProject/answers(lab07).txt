-Compare the top-level containers in Swing and AWT:
-> AWT: Frame, Dialog, Applet
-> Swing: JFrame, JDialog, JApplet
-Compare the class name of components in AWT and the corresponding classâ€™s name in Swing:
-> The class name of components in Swing have the letter "J" at the start compared to AWT (i.e. JPanel(Swing) - Panel(AWT))
- Compare the event-handling of Swing and AWT applications:
-> They are pretty much the same.
- The resulting appearances of the applications developed using Swing and AWT might be different as well. Make comparisons
-> Personally, the overall apprearances of Swing and AWT components look quite similiar.That being said, I find the Swing components look more appealing and can be more flexible since Swing components can alter their apprearances due to the fact that
Swing components can change their appearance based on the current "look and feel" library that's being used.
